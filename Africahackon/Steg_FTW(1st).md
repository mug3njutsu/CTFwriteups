## Detailed solution
Doing a bit of research on digital ink steg, led me to one java tool that could successfuly decrypt digital ink steg. The DIIT project can be found at http://diit.sourceforge.net/.Download the tool and load the image.I used the battle steg algorithm which successfully decrypted the concealed image to a text file
