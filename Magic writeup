***I spy with my magic-eye a flag! Note: FaZe Apex helped me learn this trick Note: Wrap what you get with UMDCTF-{}***

**Solve**

We are given a png and a hint of fazeapex helping with developing the trick. To some google-fu, i found fazeapex' s youtube blog that explained the method used to make the magic eye images.

I tried an online magic eye solver and got nothing. I decided to approach the challenge manually and after failing in some visual experiments of placing the image in my face(lol), i went  to google and found an article about stereograms which explained that a stereogram is a combination of 2 2D images to make a 3D image.

So i got an idea to use gimp's duplicate layer to solve the challenge. i launched the image with Gimp and on the layer tab ,duplicated the top layer of the image.
I also set the layer mode to difference so that i can note the difference between the layers off the 2 images.
 
On the transform tab i selected 'move' which i used to drag the image layer slightly and bingo! the flag was displayed after some trial and error of moving the layer.
